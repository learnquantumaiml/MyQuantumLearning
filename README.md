# QuantumLearning

Hello, 

Few months ago, I have kick started my learning journey with Quantum computing. 

I attended the AI-SEQ#2 Cohort by QuLearnLabs, and the experience was truly surreal. I am grateful to have connected with many people from different areas within the quantum domain.

About this path
AI-Assisted Software Engineering for Quantum Computing and Post-Quantum-Cryptography (PQC)
This course introduces learners to the fundamentals of quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography (PQC), with a strong emphasis on practical software engineering.
This course uses Qiskit, an open-source SDK for quantum computing by IBM, licensed under Apache 2.0.
Delivered through a blended learning format, the course empowers participants to explore quantum computing using Qiskit, the open-source quantum computing Python libraries.

A key innovation in the course is the integration of Q, an open-source AI coding assistant developed in-house by the QuLearnLabs team to support learners in writing, debugging, and optimizing code but also in accelerating the learning by enabling conversations right inside the Development Environment (IDE) where software engineers are coding and building the applications. With this hands-on and AI-enhanced approach, participants will gain the tools and knowledge needed to contribute to cutting-edge deep tech fields such as quantum software development, cryptography, and secure digital infrastructure.

Key knowledge and skills developed:

Understand core principles of quantum mechanics relevant to computing.
Develop and simulate quantum circuits using Qiskit.
Gain insight into post-quantum cryptography and quantum-safe protocols.
Use Q, the AI coding assistant, to improve code efficiency and accelerate learning.
Explore classical-quantum hybrid approaches and real-world use cases.
Build a capstone project demonstrating quantum or PQC concepts in practice.
